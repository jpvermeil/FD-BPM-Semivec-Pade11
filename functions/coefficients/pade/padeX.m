%   yg              Grid of y dimension. Has to match dimensions of n.
%                   Has to be Y output of Matlab meshgrid function ([X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z))
%   dim_y           Size of the global matrix in y-direction
%   dim_xl          Size of the local matrix in x-direction
%   dim_yl          Size of the local matrix in y-direction
%   localAdrSlgs    Contains the local address information of all elements
%   globalAdrSlgs   Contains the global address information of all elements
