% [ aSouthReshaped ] = padeS(n,xg,dim_y,dim_xl,dim_yl,localAdrE,globalAdrE,POLARIZATION,FIELDCOMPONENT)
%
% VARIABLES
%
%   n               Refractive index profile
%   xg              Grid of x dimension. Has to match dimensions of n. 
%                   Has to be X output of Matlab meshgrid function ([X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z))
%   yg              Grid of y dimension. Has to match dimensions of n.
%                   Has to be Y output of Matlab meshgrid function ([X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z))
%   dim_y           Size of the global matrix in y-direction
%   dim_xl          Size of the local matrix in x-direction
%   dim_yl          Size of the local matrix in y-direction
%   localAdrS       Contains the local address information of southern elements
%   POLARIZATION    String value that can either be 'TE' or 'TM'
%   FIELDCOMPONENTS Can be 'Ex', 'Ey', 'Hx' or 'Hy'

% This function populaltes the coefficient vector that is merged into the
% system matrix A as the respective southern diagonal of for each step in
% z-direction. It belongs to the program "Semi vectorial wide angle
% Pad√©(1,1) finite difference BPM for TE/TM E- and/or H-fields in 3D
% structures".
