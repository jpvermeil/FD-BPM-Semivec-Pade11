%   yg              Grid of y dimension. Has to match dimensions of n.
%                   Has to be Y output of Matlab meshgrid function ([X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(x,y,z))
%   dim_y           Size of the global matrix in y-direction
%   dim_xl          Size of the local matrix in x-direction
%   dim_yl          Size of the local matrix in y-direction
%   localAdrN       Contains the local address information of northern elements
%   POLARIZATION    String value that can either be 'TE' or 'TM'
%   FIELDCOMPONENTS Can be 'Ex', 'Ey', 'Hx' or 'Hy'
    
% This function populaltes the coefficient vector that is merged into the
