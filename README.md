# FD-Semivec-Pade11-BPM
Finite difference semi-vectorial wide-angle beam propagation algorithm for TE- and/or TM-Polarization of E- and/or H-fields in optical waveguide structures with arbitrary index profile. Calculation scheme is based on a semi-vectorial finite difference approach utilizing an absorbing boundary condition.

For further reference with respect to the numerical implementation please refer to appropriate literature. And excellent and comprehensive work is the book 'Introduction to Optical Waveguide Analysis: Solving Maxwell's Equations and the Schr√∂dinger Equation' by K. Kawano and T. Kitoh.

I implemented this mode solver during my time as a PhD student to complement my finite difference based Beam Propagation Method (BPM) for the excitation of optical waveguide structures with a specific mode.

For instructions on how to use the mode solver please refer to the two included examples for a single-mode step-index fiber and a graded-index multimode fiber.

The code is likely not to be maintained or supported to any extent in the future.
